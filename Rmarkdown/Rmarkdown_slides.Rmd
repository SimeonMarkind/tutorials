#Intro

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. 

Cheatsheet can be found <http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf> 

Reference guide can be found <https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf>  

Your final project is required to be done in Rmarkdown. You will want to use the pdf_document type for your write-up. Your slides for the presentation should be pdf, of type beamer.

#Setup

For today's lecture you will need to open up an Rmarkdown document. Go to File -> New File -> R Markdown and create an PDF document with your name. Title it "R Markdown Practice." 

At the top of the Rmd script you should see a section that looks like the following:

\---  
title: "Rmarkdown"   
author: "Simeon Markind"  
date: '`r format(Sys.time(), "%d %B, %Y")`'  
output: html_document  
\---

#Basics

Rmarkdown has two modes: "text and "code"

Default settings for text mode are black text on a white background.

In the text mode of a markdown document you can type text as you would in a word document and the output document simply returns exactly what you put in, tpyos and all.

#Text Formatting part 1

* Formatting Summary 
    + Two spaces at the end of a line indicate a new line.  
    + Pound symbols, #, at the beginning of a line indicate headers.  
        + You can use up to six # signs, for each additional # sign used the text becomes smaller.  
    + Surrounding your text in * or _ makes italics.
        + i.e. \*italics\* gives *italics* and \_italics\_ does as well
    + ** will bold your text as does __
        + \*\*bold\*\* and \_\_bold\_\_ gives __bold__
    + The ^ creates superscripts so x\^2\^ gives x^2^

#Text Formatting part 2

* The ~~ gives strikethrough
    + \~\~I have never used this\~\~ ~~but maybe you will~~
    + To insert links use the following syntax [text] (webaddress)
        + To learn more go [here]("rmarkdown.rstudio.com") 
    + Inline equations use Latex math mode, the \$ sign.
        + \$y = \\pi*r^{2}\$ 
        + gives $y = \pi*r^{2}$
        + If you have used LaTeX before you will be able to use many of the latex typesetting commands and functions in markdown.
        
#Text Formatting part 3

* The backslash \\ is the escape character and allows you to show \\\*text\\\* that would otherwise involve *formatting.*
* You can insert tables by hand as shown on the reference guide but I would recommend against that.
* Bullets are made with a single * sign followed by a space
    + sub-bullets are made by indenting directly below the preceding text and using a + symbol
    + Ordered lists follow the same format but instead of using * as the symbol use a number.
        + Note that you can sub-number a numbered list
        
1. Ordered list
    1. first sub-bullet  
        1a. sub-sub-bullet
        
#In Class Exercise 1

__In your Rmarkdown file add the following lines, be sure to format them properly.__

## This is the largest header size

*I have really enjoyed this course on* ~~python~~, **sorry, R**   
$5^{2} + 4 = 29$ 

* I like the following:  
    + lists  
        + sub-bullets  
        
1. numbered lists are good too
    2. They make it easy to organize things.

#LaTeX Basics

\LaTeX  is a powerful typesetting language used throughout academia and the professional world.

One of the most important features of \LaTeX for our purposes will be the use of math mode.

* Inline equations occur within the text smoothly.
* Display equations occur separate from the text.

#Inline Equations

Inline math mode is accessed using a single \$ sign surrounding each end of the equation.

* If I wanted to show: $y = \sum_{i = 1}^n mx_i^{2} + b$  
* I would type: \$y = \\sum_{i = 1}^n mx_i^{2} + b\$
* Inline math mode is accessed using a single \$ sign surrounding each end of the equation.
* The \\sum_ gives the sigma character and the x_i^{2} returns the $x_i^{2}$ symbol.

#Latex Symbol Basics

* \\sum is a built-in symbol to LaTeX. And gives $\sum$   
    + There are many others such as \\infty which gives $\infty$
* The single _ character allows for subscripts as we saw above. So \$\\sum_1\$ gives us $\sum_1$. (I will no longer explicitly show the $ symbols in the explanation but remember that you need them to display math symbols inline.)
* The ^ sign gives superscript and the brackets take the numbers to display in the superscript. So x^{2} gives $x^{2}$ 
    + The brackets can accept multiple numbers, so you could theoretically type x^{2,3} which gives $x^{2,3}$ which makes no sense.
    + However, this ability is important as we will see in a minute with subscripting. To show element A in row i and column j in a matrix you would type A_{i,j} and show $A_{i,j}$
    
#Latex Symbol Help

Putting this all together we can show another example of inline math. $\int_0^{1} x^{2}dx = \frac{x^2}{2}|_0^{1}  = \frac{1}{2} - 0 = \frac{1}{2}$. The code for which is: \$\\int_0^{1} x^{2}dx = \\frac{x^2}{2}|_0^{1}  = \\frac{1}{2} - 0 = \\frac{1}{2}\$.

* Here the | character (pipe) gives us the evaluation bar for x once we have evaluated it. 
* To see more examples of using different latex functions check out the webpage: http://www.calvin.edu/~rpruim/courses/m343/F12/RStudio/LatexExamples.html. 
* If you do not find the math symbols you are looking for there, try this CU webpage http://www.colorado.edu/physics/phys4610/phys4610_sp15/PHYS4610_sp15/Home_files/LaTeXSymbols.pdf. 
* If that fails ask google. 

#Display Equations

In addition to inline math mode, equations in Latex can also be shown in display mode. In this mode the expressions are centered and in a separate line from the main text. $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i}$$. This mode is activated by using two \$ signs surrounding the formula in place of one.

**Ok, now that you have seen how the math modes work how would you write the following in display mode? Write the following equation and knit your document. (Google the LaTeX symbol for a limit if you need)**

$$\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{1}{x} \to 0$$

# Code Mode

Embedded R code is where the power of Rmarkdown really comes through. 
* Up until now we have not really seen the difference between a markdown file and regular Latex. 
* The ability to embed R code, code that can be evaluated in-line with the text, is what makes Rmarkdown so powerful. 
* Similar to text, code chunks can be added either inline or chunk.


# Inline Code

Code made is activated via the \` character. 
* This is the character at the top left of the number row of your keyboard, on the same key as the ~. 
    + A single \` followed by text and closed by another \` creates bolded text with a different font. 
* This is useful for displaying function names such as `sum()` in a way that readers can understand to be code. 
* Inline code can also be evaluated by adding a marker denoting the language to run immediately following the \` mark. 
    + I.e. \` r sum(c(3,4,5))\` evaluates to `r sum(c(3,4,5))`. We could specify other engines instead of R if desired. 
    
# Code Chunks

* To create a new code chunk press Ctrl+Alt+I or type in three \` and specify that you want the R engine in braces like on a new line like so:

\`\`\`\{r\}

All options for the code chunk go between the braces.  
* If you inserted the code chunk with Ctrl+Alt+I it will already have a closing in it.  
* If you started the code chunk manually you must close it with three more \` on an empty line. So your code chunk should look like the following:

\`\`\` \{r options\}  
Code  
more code  
\`\`\`

Within each chunk you can write code like in a normal R script

# Basic R chunk

## For this lecture we will explore the economics dataset include with the ggplot2 package. 

#### You can name your chunk with a text string immediately after the language setting for the chunk. I.e.  

\`\`\`{r name}

You do not have to put quotes around your chunk name but you can if desired.  
\`\`\`{r "name"} is also valid.

Before we continue make sure you have the following libraries:

```{r, include=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
```

# In Class Exercise

**In your Rmarkdown document create a code chunk and copy in the following code, then knit your document.**  
```{r first chunk}
## First we should take a look at our data
head(economics)

## Now print out the number of rows in the table
nrow(economics)
```

# Changing Chunk Options

##In addition to being able to name your code chunk you can also pass in knitr options. 
###These options affect whether the code is evaluated or not, whether the code itself is shown in the output document as well as many other controls surrounding the output.
####Specifying chunk options is done after a comma within the braces of your chunk declaration like so:  

\`\`\`{r chunk name, option1 = TRUE, option2 = FALSE, etc}  
Code
More Code
\`\`\`

#Chunk Option Overview

Chunk options should be comma separated. Here are some that I frequently use:

1. echo - controls display of code
    + If echo = TRUE the code in the code chunk will be displayed
    + If echo = FALSE the code in the chunk will not be displayed (and the code will still evaluate)
    + Similar to Eval can take a vector argument as well.
2. error - controls error messages
    + If error = TRUE error messages are displayed and code continues to run
    + If error = FALSE error messages are not displayed, code does not continue to run

        
#More Chunk Options

3. Include 
    + If include = TRUE (default) the chunk will be run and included in the final document
    + If include = FALSE the chunk will be run but not included in the final document
        + E.g. plots/tables generated in the chunk are still created and accessible in other chunks
4. Eval
    + If eval = FALSE knitr will not run the code in the code chunk
    + If eval = TRUE (default) the code will be run
    + This is useful for debugging as you can turn eval to FALSE in a chunk and play around with your code but not raise issues compiling your
    document.
    + This can also take a vector to select which expression(s) to evaluate. e.g. `eval = c(2,4,5) or eval = -(4:5)`

#Even More Chunk Options
5. Comment
    + Takes an optional character argument of what to display next to R output. (i.e. comment = "Output >")
    

# In Class Exercise

A list of Chunk options can be found in the Rmarkdown reference materials. A full list of chunk options can be found at: <http://yihui.name/knitr/options/#chunk_options>


**Look at this webpage and/or the reference materials and create a code block with the following attributes:**  

* Output is preceded by the string "Rout >"  

**In your code return the subset of the economics dataset with unemployment above 10%**

```{r "options practice", comment = "Rout >", echo=FALSE}
economics %>% filter(uempmed >= 10) %>% head()
```

#Setting Chunk Options For The Entire Document

##Chunk options can also be set at the top of the markdown document using the `knitr::opts_chunk$set()` function. 
###This function can be called anywhere in the document but it is a good idea to set it at the beginning since chances set will only affect code downstream. 
####For example, if we wanted to set the default for the echo value to TRUE so that by default all of our code block would be rendered onto the final document and include to be true so that our code would always be run we could do the following in an R chunk:

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, include = TRUE)
```

# Calling Graphs

Just as we were able to show table output inline with our text above, we can also include graphics in our final output as well. 

* For ggplot objects this simply requires creating the objects and then calling them.

* Additionally, we can set chunk options either specifically or globally that change the size of our output plots.

# Example Plot

```{r "Plot code", include=TRUE}

plot.data <- economics %>% 
    filter(date >= as.Date("2006-01-01")) %>% 
    select(date, uempmed)

plot1 <- ggplot(plot.data, aes(x = date, y = uempmed)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(title = "US unemployment (monthly)", 
         x = "Date",
         y = "Percent")

```

#Plot
```{r "example plot", echo=FALSE, include=TRUE, fig.height=2, fig.width=3, fig.cap="Example caption"}
plot1
```

You may notice that this figure is smaller than the default, centered, and has a caption underneath. 

# In Class Exercise

**Create a plot, called plot2 of the unemploy variable over time from 1996-01-01 to the end of the data with the following attributes**  

* Figure height is 4 inches
* Width is 8 inches
* Alignment is right
* Caption reads "Source: Economics dataset"

#In Class Answer
**Your plot should look like this:**

```{r plot2, echo = FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, fig.align="right", fig.cap="Source: Economics Dataset"}
plot.data <- economics %>% 
    filter(date >= as.Date("1996-01-01")) %>% 
    select(date, unemploy)

plot2 <- ggplot(plot.data, aes(x = date, y = unemploy)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(title = "US unemployment (monthly)",
         x = "Date",
         y = "Unemployed (Thousands)")

plot2
```

# Inserting tables

Just like we can insert graphs into the markdown document so too can we insert tables directly in line with the text.

* The knitr package comes with the `kable` function that we can use to call a table that is more formatted than standard R output.  

```{r example table}
kable(head(economics, 3), "pandoc", 
      col.names = c("Date", "Pce", "Pop", 
                    "Psavert", "uempmed", "unemploy"), 
      align = "c")
```

# Beamer Slides

Beamer slides are the pdf version of PowerPoint. This slide show is Beamer. 

To start a Beamer slide presentation go to File -> New File -> RMarkdown -> Presentation -> PDF (Beamer)

The syntax for making a slideshow is the same as we have covered in this lecture where we made a longer-style document. The main difference is that when making a slideshow, instead of creating a large header, using a single \# will insert a new slide with whatever title you decide to give it.

#Final Project

* For your final paper you will need to do your writeup in Rmarkdown as a pdf document. 
    + The rubic allows you to write your final paper as an html document instead of a pdf document in Rmarkdown, I prefer you write a pdf.
        + Either way you must submit BOTH your .Rmd file as well as the finished knit output. So you must submit an .Rmd file as well as your .html or .pdf file
* For your final presentation you must prepare a short, 15 minute, slide show in pdf Beamer slides.
    + To create this presentation you should summarize the writeup you did for the final paper
    + You can (and should) use the same code used to generate plots/tables etc in your final paper for your presentation
* Good luck! Myself and the rest of the Instructors are looking forward to your presentations next week.
