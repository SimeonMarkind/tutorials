# tutorials

Tutorials and lessons for certain basic data science R packages I've developed as part of teaching a class at Howard University.

I help teach a course co-offered by the Federal Reserve and Howard University. Here are the materials for some of the lectures that I developed.

Each directory contains materials for a 3-hour lecture. Some lectures had more material than could be covered in class, but the amount of time it would take to use the materials would be dependent on the level of your students. Dplyr - a long lecture - was taught very early to students and thus we did not get through the entire lecture. (I would recommend breaking this into 2 lectures as I did with ggplot). All code and data needed for the lectures should be included in the directories.

Note that homework assignments are included but answer keys to the homeworks are not included as these are still live lectures and assignments.

Additionally, a sample rubric for a semester-long final project can be found in the ggplot_part1 directory. As this course was offered with the Federal Reserve we paired each student with a PhD researcher at the Board.
